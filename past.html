    Delena Wilkerson is founder of 10 Thousand Couples, an online magazine covering same-sex couples news, LGBT profiles, stories of same-sex married life and families around the globe. It is free and followed by just over 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 readers from the US, China, Canada, UK, Japan and others each month. It was created in 2009 after Wilkerson and Olson were legally married in California the year before, having had a formal commitment ceremony in 1994.  Delena commented: "We were unexpectedly taken aback by how meaningful the legality of our commitment meant to us."

This is a play with music that presents her sayings, her miracles, and her testimony.<br/>
And she does not condemn the gays or the queers or the transwomen or the trans men, and no, not the straight women nor the straight men neither.<br/>
Because she is the Daughter of God, most certainly, and almost as certainly the son also. And God's child condemns nobody.<br/>

    <p><strong>Singer-songwriter Sarah Jones is also Vicar of Ross-on-Wye and a transgendered woman.</strong> Once a year she takes a 'holiday' from her life as a vicar and tours the country with her collection of guitars performing in folk clubs and churches. We're looking forward to an evening of Sarah's music and conversation about her unusual life.</p>
    <p><strong>Sarah first came to people's attention in the folk clubs of South Yorkshire</strong> in the mid 1990's playing a mixture of covers and her own songs. She dropped the covers, moved to Birmingham and formed a duo with Lorna Bryant which quickly became one of the Midland's premier acts. They released a CD entitled Desire which featured twelve of Sarah's songs in June 1998 to much critical acclaim. Ric Saunders of Fairport Convention heard it and liked the music so much that he turned up at one of their gigs and played fiddle with them!</p>
    <p>Sarah has since released two further albums; Freedom with her band TALA and First Person Plural.</p>
    <p>Sarah was thrust into the national spotlight in 2005 when, while serving as curate at Ross on Wye, she was outed as transgendered by the national press. With the support of her bishop and parish the news agenda moved on and she has been able to continue her ministry there.</p>
